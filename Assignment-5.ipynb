    "A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.\n",

    "\n",
    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It allows you to control access to the internal state of an object, ensuring that the data remains consistent and protected from unauthorized access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Abstraction:\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features and behaviors. It helps in managing complexity by providing a high-level view of an object's functionality, making it easier to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Inheritance:\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reuse, as subclasses can reuse the attributes and methods of their parent classes while also adding their own specific features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Polymorphism:\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of various classes without needing to know their specific types. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (providing a specific implementation in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists)."
